class Solution:

        Determines if all courses can be completed given prerequisites.

        A course schedule is valid (can finish all courses) if there is no cycle
        in the course dependency graph (i.e., the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph - DAG).

        Parameters:
        - numCourses (int): total number of courses labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1
        - prerequisites (List[List[int]]): list of [course, prerequisite] pairs

        Returns:
        - bool: True if all courses can be completed, False otherwise

        Time Complexity:
        - O(n + e), where n = numCourses and e = number of prerequisites
          - We visit every course once and every edge once.

        Space Complexity:
        - O(n + e)
          - O(n) for indegree array and queue
          - O(e) for adjacency list representation of the graph
