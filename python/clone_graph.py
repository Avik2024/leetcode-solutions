"""
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:  O(V + E)
- Each node is visited exactly once (V = number of vertices).
- Each edge is processed once when traversing neighbors (E = number of edges).

üíæ Space Complexity: O(V)
- Hash map `visited` stores a clone for every original node ‚Üí O(V).
- Recursion stack depth can go up to O(V) in the worst case (graph shaped like a line).
